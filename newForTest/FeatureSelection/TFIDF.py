
# TF - IDF
# Know some libs but I want to implement by myself
# TF is the term frequency, the appearance in a news
# IDF is inverse document frequency, it means it is not that common in news
# so, if a word is not common but appears a lot in a news, its keyword !!!!!
# TF = (the appearing times of a word in a new) / (the amount of words in that news OR the max frequency in this news)
# IDF = log(the amount of news / (the amount of news that contains this word + 1))
